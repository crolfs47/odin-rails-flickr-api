## The Odin Project - Flickr API

Create a simple photo widget that allows you to display photos from your Flickr feed.

This app allows you to input a Flickr user ID and displays that user's photos by interacting with the Flickr API.

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Rails 
 - Ruby
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github
 - Flickr API and Flickr gem
 - Figaro gem to store API key in environment variables

## What I learned:
 - How to connect and use data from an external API
 - How to use the Figaro gem to store my API key safely
 
## Still can improve:
 - User interface - I kept this very basic and didn't add any styling
